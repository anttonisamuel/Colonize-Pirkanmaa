# Colonize-Pirkanmaa
My biggest school project with C++ yet.

# How to play
Start off by naming 1-4 players. If names are given correctly, the input field's backround will be green, if not it will be red. You can read Pirkanmaa's epic backround story by clicking the Lore-button at the dialog. 

After player names are given and Play-button is pressed, the game starts. As you can now see, there are different kinds of tiles in the map:

 - Water (blue)
 - Sand (yellow)
 - Forest (dark green) 
 - Grassland (light green)
 - Rock (gray)
 
 Every tile generates each resource ......TEE LOPPUUN 

# While doing this I learned to....
 - Design and implement a bit more complicated GUI using Qt and C++ 
 - Use version control properly and work in a coding team
 - Use inheritance with abstract baseclasses and virtual functions
 - Use submodules
 - Handle errors (throw and catch)
