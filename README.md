# Colonize-Pirkanmaa
My biggest school project with C++ yet.

# About the game
After player names are given and Play-button is pressed, the game starts. As you can now see, there are different kinds of tiles in the map:
 - Water (blue)
 - Sand (yellow)
 - Forest (dark green) 
 - Grassland (light green)
 - Rock (gray)
 Each tile type generates a different amount of each resource:
 - Money
 - Food
 - Wood
 - Stone
 - Ore
 
 Building, that can be placed on tiles are:
 - Headquarters
 - Outpost
 - Farm
 - Mine 
 - Oil rig
 
 Each building has a poteintial to generate a different amount of recources depending on the building type. To actually generate recources, you must place worker(s) on a builiding. There are 3 type of workers in the game:
 - Basic worker (produces every recource)
 - Farmer (skilled at producing food)
 - Miner (skilled at producing stone and ore)
 
# How to play
Start off by naming 1-4 players. If names are given correctly, the input field's backround will be green, if not it will be red. You can read Pirkanmaa's epic backround story by clicking the Lore-button at the dialog. 

# While doing this I learned to....
 - Design and implement a bit more complicated GUI using Qt and C++ 
 - Use version control properly and work in a coding team
 - Use inheritance with abstract baseclasses and virtual functions
 - Use submodules
 - Handle errors (throw and catch)
